Arctic Seal<br/>
This race used to have a grand underwater civilization. Unfourtunatly when it was attacked, these seals didn't have the combat prowess to defend it. Now they are scattered far and wide, their civilization mostly forgotten.<br/>
游릭 Chonky: You have an extra 10 hearts.<br/>
游릭 Beefy Lungs: You can hold your breath for a ridiculously long time, but it is not forever.<br/>
游릭 Aqua Eyes: You have perfect underwater vision.<br/>
游리 Legs of Neptune: Using your legs, you are immensely fast in water, but they aren't very useful on land. You can't move very fast on land.<br/>
游리 Smol Chonk: You are one block, both in height and in width.<br/>
游리 Picky eater: While you can only eat fish, you can digest them more efficiently.<br/>
游리 Blubber: You are too chonky for armor to fit on you. You can still wear a helmet though.<br/>
游댮 Heat Sink: You rapidly overheat in hot climates, taking damage over time.<br/>
游댮 Highly Flammable: Did you know that blubber is highly flammable? You take double fire damage.<br/>
游댮 Flippers: Your hands are largely useless. You cannot use bows, crossbows, shields, and all projectiles excluding tridents, and all damage you deal is only half as effective.<br/>
